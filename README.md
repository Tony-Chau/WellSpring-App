# WellSpring-App
<p>This is the re-upload version of the previous Wellspring App that was made, but was removed due to unknown reasons. This app was made in Xamarin (MVVM) and Azure DB server. The App is no longer functional as the Azure server for this app has expired, but some of its basic features can still be used. </p>

<p>This app was developed by 4 students during their course in IAB330. Only 2 students are known to create this app </p>
